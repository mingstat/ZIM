\title{Zero-Inflated Models for Count Time Series with Excess Zeros}
\description{
Fits observation-driven and parameter-driven models for count time series with excess zeros.
}
\details{
The package \code{ZIM} contains functions to fit statistical models for count time series 
with excess zeros (Yang et al., 2013, 2015). The main function for fitting observation-driven models 
is \code{\link{zim}}, and the main function for fitting parameter-driven models is \code{\link{dzim}}.
}
\note{
The observation-driven models for zero-inflated count time series can also be fit using the function 
\code{\link[pscl]{zeroinfl}} from the \code{pscl} package (Zeileis et al., 2008). 
Fitting parameter-driven models is based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, which are
computer intensive and could take several hours to estimate the model parameters.
